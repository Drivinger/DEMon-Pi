## Script Name: plot.py

### Functionality
The `ploty.py` script is designed to facilitate the generation and saving of plots for the emulations described in a research paper. It automates the process of creating various plots based on data stored in a database (`experiments.db`) where the results of different experiments are consolidated.

### Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the `experiments.db` database file in the same directory as the script or provide the path to the database as an argument when executing the script.

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python plot.py
